dApp DEFI dashboard

An ambitious project to dive into the world of Decentralized Finance Applications. This project's purpose is to facilitate and automate arbitrage opportunities leveraging Aave protocols to make crypto trades uncollateralized.

1) allow easy interaction with contracts.
2) monitor analytics, opportunities, projections.

This is a monorepo that will version a frontend UI and a backend server.
